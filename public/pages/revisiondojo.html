            <p>
              RevisionDojo is leading the IB edtech space, constantly launching new features, with over 7+ released in a single month. However, there is no infrastructure to sustain this fast-paced growth, leading to new features and content often getting buried in the crowded navigation bar

              An omnidirectional search bar modal that lives on any page of the app, enabling IB students to navigate RevisionDojo while effectively surfacing the features and content they are looking for.

              <h2 class="section-title">User Testing</h2>
              <p>
                To validate our assumptions, I conducted user tests of our solution with six former IB students, some familiar with RevisionDojo. The questions focused on understanding why users acted as they did when interacting with the feature, revealing how they navigated the interface and whether they would actually use the tool.
              </p>
            </div>

          <div class="user-testing-section">
            <p class="user-testing-title">Some user testing questions:</p>

            <div class="user-testing-questions">
              <div class="question-card">
                <p>Are you able to explain to me what you think is happening on the page?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="question-card">
                <p>You are unsure what you are looking for. What on this screen are you inclined to press? Why?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="question-card">
                <p>If you were studying for IB, how might you find this tool helpful? Why?</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            To gather further insights, I ran a series of A/B tests: in one test, users were guided through a more structured set of tasks, while in the other, they were allowed to explore the interface freely, with the same guiding questions asked along the way.
          </p>

          <div>
              <h2>User Test Outcomes</h2>
              <p>
                The virtual user tests revealed common pain points, such as broadening the search to include syllabus acronyms, more intuitive result highlighting, and additional filters for error states. I found feedback from interviewing designers focused more on UI and the nitty-gritty, while non-designers provided intuitive, user-centred insights.

              <h2>Impact</h2>
              <p>
                During testing, users prioritized efficiency, which guided the UX changes to make the app as intuitive and clear as possible. Our goal was to design RevisionDojo to adapt seamlessly to the needs of busy, ambitious IB students.

              <h2>Takeaways</h2>
              <p>
                Validate your assumption! During our research and ideation, we let a lot of our assumptions fill in the gaps for our solutions. Part of the reason we kept refraining from our solutions was due to constantly finding holes in our research, which created gaps in our research. I learned to validate, validate, validate our process through secondary research and user testing, to cover all grounds.
